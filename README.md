# Enigma-Machine

## Some History:
The Enigma machine is a cipher device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military communication.
It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II, in all branches of the German military.
The Enigma machine was considered so secure that it was used to encipher the most top-secret messages.

## The entities:
### • UBoat 
A German submarine responsible for determining an initial code for the machine, distributing an encrypted message and deciding which of the different teams was able to decode the message accurately (winner of the competition).

### • Allies  
Decoding teams of the allies competing among themselves to be the first to succeed in deciphering the encrypted message transmitted by the UBoat.

### • Agent
Agents who are members of the various decoding teams and are responsible for performing the decoding tasks themselves. Each agent is a member of exactly one team.
